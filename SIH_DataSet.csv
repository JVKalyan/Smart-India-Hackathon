1,Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY),"Hon’ble Prime Minister announced Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as the National Mission on Financial Inclusion in his Independence Day address on 15th August 2014, to ensure comprehensive financial inclusion of all the households in the country by providing universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic bank account to every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension facility. Under this, a person not having a savings account can open an account without the requirement of any minimum balance and, in case they self-certify that they do not have any of the officially valid documents required for opening a savings account, they may open a small account. Further, to expand the reach of banking services, all of over 6 lakh villages in the country were mapped into 1.59 lakh Sub Service Areas (SSAs), with each SSA typically comprising of 1,000 to 1,500 households, and in the 1.26 lakh SSAs that did not have a bank branch, Bank Mitras were deployed for branchless banking.

Thus, PMJDY offers unbanked persons easy access to banking services and awareness about financial products through financial literacy programmes. In addition, they receive a RuPay debit card, with inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs. 2 lakh, and access to overdraft facility upon satisfactory operation of account or credit history of six months. Further, through Prime Minister’s Social Security Schemes, launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 9th May 2015, all eligible account holders can access through their bank accounts personal accident insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, life insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, and guaranteed minimum pension to subscribers under Atal Pension Yojana.

PMJDY was conceived as a bold, innovative and ambitious mission. Census 2011 estimated that out of 24.67 crore households in the country, 14.48 crore (58.7%) had access to banking services. In the first phase of the scheme, these households were targeted for inclusion through opening of a bank account within a year of launch of the scheme. The actual achievement, by 26th January 2015, was 12.55 crore. As on 27.3.2019, the number of accounts has grown to 35.27 crore. Further, in 2011, only 0.33 lakh SSAs had banking facility and through provision of Bank Mitras in 1.26 lakh branchless SSAs, banking services were extended throughout rural India. The inclusive aspect of this is evident from the fact that 20.90 crore (60%) of PMJDY accounts are in rural areas and 18.74 crore (over 53%) PMJDY account holders are women.

The deposit base of PMJDY accounts has expanded over time. As on 27.3.2019, the deposit balance in PMJDY accounts was Rs. 96,107 crore. The average deposit per account has more than doubled from Rs. 1,064 in March 2015 to Rs. 2,725 in March 2019.

The Bank Mitra network has also gained in strength and usage. The average number of transactions per Bank Mitra, on the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System operated by Bank Mitras, has risen by over eightyfold, from 52 transactions in 2014-15 to 4,291 transactions in 2016-17.

From Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha
For creating a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor and the under-privileged the Hon’ble Prime Minister launched three Social Security Schemes in the Insurance and Pension sectors on 9th of May, 2015.

Atal Pension Yojana (APY)
APY was launched on 9th May, 2015 by the Prime Minister. APY is open to all saving bank/post office saving bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 40 years and the contributions differ, based on pension amount chosen.  Subscribers would receive the guaranteed minimum monthly pension of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000 or Rs. 3,000 or Rs. 4,000 or Rs. 5,000 at the age of 60 years. Under APY, the monthly pension would be available to the subscriber, and after him to his spouse and after their death, the pension corpus, as accumulated at age 60 of the subscriber, would be returned to the nominee of the subscriber. The minimum pension would be guaranteed by the Government, i.e., if the accumulated corpus based on contributions earns a lower than estimated return on investment and is inadequate to provide the minimum guaranteed pension, the Central Government would fund such inadequacy. Alternatively, if the returns on investment are higher, the subscribers would get enhanced pensionary benefits.

In the event of pre-mature death of the subscriber, Government has decided to give an option to the spouse of the subscriber to continue contributing to APY account of the subscriber, for the remaining vesting period, till the original subscriber would have attained the age of 60 years. The spouse of the subscriber shall be entitled to receive the same pension amount as that of the subscriber until the death of the spouse.

Kaithal (Haryana), Mar 22: Congress on Sunday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given ‘false assurances’ to the farmers in his ‘Mann ki baat’ address and alleged that the latter is attempting to justify the amended Land Acquisition Bill, which is meant to benefit only the capitalists. “Prime Minister’s ‘Maan ki baat’ today turned out to be a lie and was proved to be for capitalists. The farmers have now come to a conclusion that both Modi and unseasonal rains are responsible for the bad condition. Instead of giving compensation for those affected of hailstorm and rain, he has just given false assurances,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told ANI. (ALSO READ: Pained by farmers’ woes, says Narendra Modi in Mann Ki Baat)

“We would like to ask Prime Minister Modi why his government destroyed the soul and body of 2013 Land Acquisition Bill. The new law is for capitalists, and to justify that they are making false promises, and telling lies,” he added. Speaking to farmers on sixth edition of the radio programme ‘Mann ki baat’ earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the amendments in the Land Acquisition Bill were made for welfare of people and villages. “We felt that there was a need to bring some amendments in the law, we only wish for welfare of people and villages. If states have objection to amendments in Land Acquisition Bill, they can continue with the old law,” Prime Minister Modi said in ‘ Mann ki baat’.

“I assure all my farmer brothers that I will alert all state governments as well as all departments in the Central Government over the issues that you have raised…..I have said in Parliament, that if someone still feels some changes are required, we are willing to take up suggestions. We are emphasizing on health of mother land as well, which is why we’ve started soil health card scheme. I assure you that I will not break your trust,” he added.",https://www.india.com/news/india/congress-accuses-narendra-modi-of-giving-false-assurances-to-farmers-in-mann-ki-baat-326115/,FALSE
4,Inefficiency Of Government  on national schemes,"Bureaucracy is lazy and has all the paper rules to put spanners in the works. As bureaucracy is an important functionary for implementing schemes and policy. Political executive is to were to making policy, administration is to implement policy. Majority of government officials are just not to fit to carry out their duties correctly& diligently.
They are just not serious in carrying out their work. Only 10 percent of total grants actually can be used for any scheme implementation, rest of 90 percent goes in pay and other allowances & sundry contingencies. The failure of some programmes, like the mid-day meal programme in Madhya Pradesh, the integrated child development programme in Bihar, etc. and NAREGA in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha are examples of those that have failed due to improper monitoring, a lack of accountability, misaligned incentives, and corruption.",Failure Of Implementing Schemes And Policy In India,FALSE

8,Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme,"The team’s visit comes days after Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari alleged that funds allocated for the mid-day meal scheme were diverted to other schemes. Mr. Adhikari alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee diverted funds allotted for the mid-day meal scheme to compensate the survivors of the Bogtui violence. He said that he will bring the matter to the notice of Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. Apart from allegations of fund irregularities in the scheme, there have also been reports of unhygienic practices during the preparation of meals.

Under the PM Poshan scheme, the Union Government had recently allocated ?372 crore to the State in order to provide nutrition to school students. The State’s Education Minister Bratya Basu said that the Centre, upon being impressed by the performance of the State in the implementation of the mid-day meal scheme, released additional funds to the tune of ?250 crore to the School Education Department for infrastructure development.

Prior to this, the Union government had sent over teams to oversee the implementation of the MGNREGA scheme in the State and to look into the alleged irregularities in the PM Awas Yojana scheme.

The Trinamool Congress had described sending central teams to the State as an act of “political vendetta. “On the one hand, the Centre is blocking funds to West Bengal, and on the other hand, they are sending such teams to the State,” Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen said.
